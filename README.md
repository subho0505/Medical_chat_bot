## 🔹 Setting Up a Python Virtual Environment

Using Python’s built-in tools, you’ll create and activate a virtual environment to isolate your project’s dependencies.

### 1️⃣ Create the Virtual Environment

Open **Command Prompt**, navigate to your project folder, and run:

```bash
python -m venv myvenv
```

### 2️⃣ Activate the Environment

In the same terminal, activate the environment:

```bash
myvenv\Scripts\activate
```

You should now see something like `(myvenv)` at the beginning of your command line—this means your virtual environment is active!

### 3️⃣ Install Project Dependencies

Now, install all necessary packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

✅ You’re now ready to run the application!

## 🔹 Running the Application

Your application is split into four main phases. You can run each one individually depending on what you're working on.

### 🧠 Phase 1: **Brain of the Doctor**
Runs the core logic powering the doctor’s decision-making:
```bash
python brain_of_the_doctor.py
```

### 🎙️ Phase 2: **Voice of the Patient**
Handles speech input and recognition from the patient:
```bash
python voice_of_the_patient.py
```

### 🗣️ Phase 3: **Voice of the Doctor**
Converts the doctor's response into spoken audio:
```bash
python voice_of_the_doctor.py
```

### 💻 Phase 4: **Setup Gradio UI**
Launches the interactive UI using Gradio:
```bash
python gradio_app.py
```

---

## 🔹 Additional Notes

- 🔁 **Always activate the virtual environment** before working:
  ```bash
  myvenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- ❌ **To deactivate** when you're done:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

🎉 That’s it! Your Windows environment is now fully set up for development. If you run into any issues, feel free to ask for help. Happy coding!
